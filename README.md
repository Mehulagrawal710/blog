Appointy interview

I have attempted the first part of the 'OR' in the problem statement in which i have made the frontend which performs the functionality of adding, updating, deleting and viewing posts.
The technology used is Angular JS.

The following options are available-
1. <kbd>Add Post</kbd> - to add a new post.
2. <kbd>Update Post</kbd> - to edit a posted post.
3. <kbd>Delete Post</kbd> - to delete a posted post.
4. <kbd>Get all Posts</kbd> - to view all the posts.

*On clicking on the above options, A window shows up which asks for details(title, description, Id) of the post for performing the corresponding functionality.

An option for liking <kbd>&#10084;</kbd> a post is also available.
